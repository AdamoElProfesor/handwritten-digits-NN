# Handwritten digits Neural Network

##  🔍 Goals

1. This project is about building a feed-forward neural network model from 
scratch that predicts accurately ( over 80% ) handwritten digits.
2. The model should be publicly deployed and reachable with an API
3. Create a website using the gradio framework giving details about the 
model. The website should also contain a "drawing tool", allowing users to 
try out the model and see if it predicts right or wrong.
